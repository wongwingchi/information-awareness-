        <P style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.5; ">Information distortion refers to the fact that the content, meaning or context of the information is distorted or deformed during the dissemination of information, causing the recipient to obtain inaccurate or misleading information. In the process of using the Internet and social media, we are all likely to encounter information distortion. Information distortion includes not only the intentional spread of false information, but also the unintentional misunderstanding or distortion of information.</P>

        <p style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 1.5;">"People are more willing to accept information that conforms to their preconceived opinions. This phenomenon is called cognitive bias in psychology. Publishers will hope to use people's emotional reactions, especially fear and anger, to touch people's basic emotions and identities to achieve their goals. And In the era of information overload, people are often unable to verify every piece of information in detail. Therefore, if the information comes from an authoritative media, people will most likely lose their ability to identify, especially in a situation where the minority obeys the herd effect of the majority. Under the influence, people lose their critical thinking.</p>

    <p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;background-color: aliceblue;">In the COVID-19 epidemic, a serious misleading message came out of Iran. There was a saying among the Iranian people that consuming high concentrations of alcohol can eliminate the new coronavirus in the body.<br> This led hundreds of Iranian people to buy methanol-containing industrial alcohol and take it. However, in fact, methanol is a harmful compound that can cause blindness, organ damage, and even death when ingested. Therefore, after this misleading information was miscommunicated, many people suffered from poisoning and health problems.  Many citizens who regard formaldehyde as a good medicine do not know that this information is wrong.  This affects many people and their famliy.</p>

    summary
    </h1>

<p style="background-color: black; font-size: 30px; padding: 15ch; color: aliceblue; line-height: 1.5;">In the age of globalization, information distortion is ubiquitous in our daily lives, and these information distortions can spread rapidly across multiple platforms, causing a huge impact on us and even the entire national society. By analyzing examples such as the fear-mongering of fake news, the misleading effect of rumors, misleading information, and disinformation, we see how this information distorts facts and misleads the public, and understands why people believe this information. Information is important for improving our information recognition. Competencies and media literacy are critical. Allow us to make smarter decisions, develop the habit of critical thinking and verify information.</p>

            <p>
            <p style="font-size:30px;">With the rampant rise of fake news and misinformation 
                on the internet, we must stay <b>cautious</b> at all times when coming across new information on the internet. 
                So, what are some of the ways that we can prevent ourselves from being subjected to the decisiveness of 
                fake news and such?</p>

                <p style="font-size:30px;">Of course, one of the <mark>easiest</mark> way that we can do this would be to <b>confirm if the sources are true or false</b>, 
                    aka <b><mark>fact-checking</mark></b>. According to <b>Zhou et al.</b>, they have stated in their research that to detect misinformation 
                    on the internet, one of the <b>simplest and straightforward ways</b> is to simply fact-check by ourselves and <b>reevaluate the 
                    information we’ve consumed</b>. Not only we can confirm the <mark>authenticity</mark> of the information from different sources, 
                    but we would also be less likely to be gullible to fake news and misinformation.
                </p>

                <p>But how do we actually <b>“fact-check”?</b> Here is a video by John Spencer that simplifies the process of fact-checking. 
                </p>
                <iframe width="948" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xf8mjbVRqao" title="Helping Students Identify Fake News with the Five C&#39;s of Critical Consuming" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>He mentioned that fact-checking can be done with the “5 C’s principle”. 
                </p>

                <ol class="listStyle_Niki">
                    <li><b>Context</b>. We should look closely at the <b>details</b> of the articles we read, such as their publication dates and sources. 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Credibility</b>. We should always check the <b>credibility</b> of the source we view. For example, 
                        we should <b>not</b> be looking at sketchy rumour sites to look for news, and instead head to websites owned by large 
                        companies or is widely known to be credible such as BBC News, CNN, the New York Times, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Construction</b>. We should <b>analyze the wording and content</b> of the articles we look at, such as if there are any 
                        <b>biases or wordings</b> that may contribute to these biases and lead to us being subjected to warped opinions. 
                        We should also look for if the information is a fact or simply an opinion.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Corroboration</b>. We should look at more articles in order to <b>broaden our perspective</b> on the subject matter and 
                        find other sources making the same claim. This allows us to check if the subject that we’re looking for is true or
                         false. 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Compare</b>. While we get information from credible sources, we can also get our information from other sources 
                        that have different ideological or political opinions in order to understand the big picture of the situation. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Thus, by increasing our media literacy and broadening our understanding of fake news, rumours, disinformation and misinformation, 
                    we gain a better reason to be responsible for what we share on the internet and not contribute to such.</p>
